# Snake Game

Welcome to Snake Game! This is a simple browser-based game where you control a snake to eat food and grow longer without hitting the walls or the snake itself.

## Instructions

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake: up, down, left, and right.
- The snake will automatically move in the direction you choose.
- Guide the snake to eat the food (represented by apples) to grow longer.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake itself, as this will end the game.
- Your score will increase each time the snake eats food.
- The game keeps track of your highest score, which is stored locally in your browser.
